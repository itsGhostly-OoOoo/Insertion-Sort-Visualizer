# Insertion-Sort-Visualizer
A small project that randomly creates an array of 100 values, displays the values as rectangles on a window, and then shows the visualization of the insertion sort algorithm live.

# This is my FIRST project!
I have never coded in Java before, and I haven't used GitHub before! So there is plenty of things wrong with this!

I just wanted to work on a project that used JavaFX and also combined what I'm learning in my algorithms class to get a good feel for how Java, and class structures are meant to work.
